# Point Of Sale System made with python
I make a P.O.S system with python for small shop using Python. For the database i just use SQLITE for this time because i dont have much knowledge in using cloud database like mysql. I will always update this project

_`PYTHON 3.8`To run this project you can start from session_start.py, and for the database
you can change the path at `server.py`, var `SERVER_PATH`_ to actual local db location

_~~I will add a function to access server database~~_


###### TO EDIT SQLITE DB You need to download DB BROWSER for SQLite
###### To log in you can use `ADMIN` to get fully access
###### FIXED DATABASE PATH. SORRY IM FORGOT ABOUT THAT
