# Python-Point-Of-Sale-System
I make a P.O.S system with python for my father company Rozeriya Enterprise using Python. For the database i just use SQLITE for this time because i dont have much knowledge in using cloud database like mysql. I will always update this project

_`PYTHON 3.8`To run this project you can start from session_start.py, and for the database
you can change the path at `server.py`, var `SERVER_PATH`_ to actual db location

Actually I try to make a database server but I did not know how to do that so I just using my computer 
to become a host for local network and the database is inside network folder, because of that
I the path it actually my network path
